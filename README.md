# snes_move_trainer

* Install pygame

Once that is installed, right now you run the script with python3.

python3 trainer.py

*Right now the script is setup to train for a mockball*

As a note, it's not great. I want to add timing, etc into it. However right now it times how fast you can perform the move.
